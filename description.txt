first i want to find out how many bytes are per string in python. From testing characters of ascii it stores in 1 byte, other for
example russian charactersstores in 2 bytes each.
And if I make string of combination of them? for example 'g1Ñ†'(last one russsian letter) - 1 byte for first letter, 1 for second and 2 for the russian
one.

If i store characters in lsb way in WAV file it's isnt a problem, but as i want to do it in random places and find them by sharedkey to make it harder
to notice changes I need to indicate number of bytes for each character. maybe i will do it iin the key?

so suppose the key will be something like - nr_bytes-byte_position|nr_bytes-byte_position.. for each letter and the key will be actually the places to get the
message from. Yes thats possible.

So for example i want to hide message inside wav file. I hide and the code generates this key. The key too long, options - shring the key using(known)
symmetric key for user experience. So even very long keys(data for each character will be small). yea good idea.

So i will implement option to hide data without need for key(all data in the beginning in lsb bits) and option to do that reandomly.

The new idea - we will always hide using key. The user will choose to hode string or file. waht type will be in key. if file filename also will be inside
key. And of couurse the positions for each bit.
